As a light beam travels outward from most light sources - the exceptions  include lasers and searchlights - the beam spreads to cover a larger area.
Distance greatly weakens illumination from such sources.
The same amount of light will cover a larger area if the surface it reaches is moved farther away.

This results in weaker illumination, following the inverse-square law.
If the distance from the source is doubled, 
the amount of light falling on a given area is reduced to one-fourth-the inverse of two squared.

If the distance is tripled, the area receives only one-ninth of the original illumination - the inverse of three squared.
