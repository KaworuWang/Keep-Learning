is our food safe to eat?

food provides you with the energy needed for everything you do and with all the chemicals your body needs to grow,
to repair damage, and to stay healthy. When you take a mouthful of food, you probably enjoy the taste.

Depending on what you are eating, you might expect your food to be good for you, too.
But what if the food you eat actually makes you sick?
if food looks or smells bad, chances are you won't eat it, but could there be hidden dangers that you cannot detect.

Animals are raised in conditions specifically calculated to allow more food to be produced more quickly and in smaller spaces.
Chemicals are used to improve the look or taste of food and to help it last longer.

Organisms can now be changed in laboratories in ways that would once have taken many years of selective breeding.
And global transportation means that we can have fresh food from anywhere in the world - at any time of the year.
