Applications of Genertic Engineering

Becasuse genetic engineering is a relatively new technology, scientists are still exploring its wealth of potential applications.
Three areas that have already seen important developments resulting from genetic engineering are medicine, industry, and agriculture.

The practice of producing genetically modified organisms is not without controversy, some governemnt agencies and ecologists, as well as numerous consumer groups, have voiced serious serious reservations about the safety of such organisms and the products produced using them.
While many of these objections have merit, it is unlikely that the use of genetic engineering in agriculture will be halted.
Although GMOs are banned in some countries, the avst majority of the soybeans, cotton, and corn raised commericially in the United States are genetically modified.
