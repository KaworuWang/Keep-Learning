It is thus all the energy an object has because of its motion and its position.
Machines - from simple tools such as wedges, levers, and pulleys, to complex devices such as automobiles - use mechanical energy to do work.

A hammer uses mechanical energy to drive a nail into a board.
When raised above the nail, the hammer has potential energy from the work done in lifting it.

When the hammer is moved toward the nail, the potential engery becomes kinetic energy, which can do the work of driving the nail.
Contact between the hammer and the nail transfers energy to the nail and then to the board.
