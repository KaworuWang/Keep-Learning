Friction onverts the mechanical energy from quickly and suddenly rotating car tires to heat energy.
The heat breaks the bonds of rubber in the tires and leaves skid marks on the road shutterstock.com

Friction plays a role in most mechanical situations.
It may change some or all of the mechanical energy of the system to heat energy.

For example, if a nail is driven into a wall, the work done by the hammer goes into energy of deformation na dinto a large amount of heat.

The nail and the head fo the hammer grow hot.
