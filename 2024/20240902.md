Animals without backbones

The simplest animals make up the phylum porifera.
The most familiar kinds are the sponges.
They are called pore bearers becuase they are covered with millions of tiny pores, or openings.

The phylum mollusca includes the calm, oyster, chiton, snail octopus, and squid.
Mollusks have soft, fleshky bodies not divided into segments.
The main part of the body is enclosed in a fold of tissue called the mantle.
They have bilateral symmetry.
