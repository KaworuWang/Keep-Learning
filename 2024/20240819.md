Every living thing is made up of tiny units called cells.
Each cell contains a set of instructions, known as its genetic code or genome, Which controls everything that happens in the organism.

In this example of genetic engineering, a gene for yellowness is transferred from a yellow pepper plant via a bacterium to a red tomato plant.
The process creates a new plant that will produce yellow tomatoes.

Once the new gene has been inserted, the host organism can be grown and tested.
Scientists check that the new gene has been incorporated into the organism's genome and that the new characteristic is present.

How do chemicals affect our foods.

Many people are not comfortable with the idea of using Chemicals in food production.
Organic food is produced without the addition of any chemicals to the soil, crops, or animals.

Although all chemicals are tested before they can be used on crops or animals or added to foods during processing, some people think that we do not know enough about their possible long-term effects.

It can be argued that chemicals now though to be safe may in the future be found to be harmful.
