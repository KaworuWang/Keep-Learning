The word amphibian come from the greek amphi, meaning "both," and bios, meaning "life".
It describes cold-blooded animals with backbones that pass their lives both in fresh water and on land.
Because amphibians live in water and on land, their natural environmnents are shores, ponds, marshes, and low-lying meadows.

They use leaves to clean their bodies and as sponges to pick up drinking water from tholes in three trunks.
In addition, they often modify objects to suit their purpose
for example, stripping a wig of its leaves before plunging it into an anthill.

Studeis suggest that the use of tools is not instinctive but rather is learned by juveniles through objeservation and imitation of adults.
