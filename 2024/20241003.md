Ohter commonly used sampling techniques include stratified sampling, cluster sampling, and systematic sampling.
All these are variations of simple random sampling.

It was commonly believed that this fraction should eventually be close to p. 
This is what bernoulli proved in a precise manner by showing that as the number of repetitions increases indefintiely, the probability  of this fraction being within any prespecified distance from p approaches 1.
