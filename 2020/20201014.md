5] Under the law in Massachusetts,tobacco companies have to measure the nicotine content of every type of cigarette and report the results.[6]The Department of Public Health in Boston gathers and carefully examines the figures，and then draws its conclusions：116 brands were looked at for the study.82 were found to have

　　higher nicotine yields than they did 6 years previously.[6]The biggest increase is tended to be in brands that were popular with young smokers，that worries the Department because of the addicted nature of nicotine.Stanton Glantz，a professor of medicine in San Francisco explains why.“The amount of nicotine was delivered in every type of cigarettes is 10 percent higher than it was 6 years ago，which means that it’s easier to get hooked and harder to quit.[7]The big tobacco companies have always insisted that they are flank with their customers about the dangers of smoking and provide them with enough detail to make an informed decision.However，[7]none of them were prepared to comment on this study or discuss the detailed nicotine content of their products.”
