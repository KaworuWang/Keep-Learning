女士：是什么事?

　　M: Well, ever since Sandra left the department, I feel like I’ve been targeted to do all her work as well as mine. I'm expected to attend too many meetings and I seem to be spending a lot of my time doing unnecessary paperwork.

　　男士：啊，自从桑德拉离开我们部门之后，我感觉我就承包了她的工作，一直干两个人的活儿。我需要参加很多会议，而且浪费很多时间在做一些不重要的文书工作上。

　　W: I'm sorry to hear that.

　　女士：听你这么说我很遗憾。

　　M: And, on top of that, I'd specifically asked if I could leave early last Friday as I'd done a lot of overtime during the week. But that afternoon, even though I'd finished my assigned work, I was told to help other colleagues finish their work, too. 男士：而且还有，上周五我明确提出希望早点下班，因为那一周我已经加班很多了。但是我下午完成分配给我的任务之后，他又让我帮助其他同事。

　　W: But surely that's a positive sign showing that Mr. Bond has a lot of trust in you.

　　女士：但是这明显表明邦德先生很信任你啊。

　　M: Yes, but other colleagues get to leave early, and they don't have such a lot of work to do.

　　男士：是的，但是其他同事都可以早点下班，他们也没有很多工作要做。 W: So you feel he's been making unrealistic demands on you?

　　女士：那么你是觉得他对你的要求过于高了对吗?

　　M: Yes, absolutely.

　　男士：对，是的。

　　W: Have you approached Mr. Bond about this particular problem?

　　女士：你就这个问题找过邦德先生吗?

　　M: I've tried, but it seems like he just has no time for me. 男士：我试过，但是他似乎没有时间理我。

　　W: Well, at this stage, it would be better if you approached him directly. If nothing else showing that you've tried to solve the problem yourself, before you take it farther, makes it clear that you're not just a complainer. Why don't you send an email requesting a meeting with him in private?

　　女士：那么，现阶段，还是你直接找他比较好。在采取进一步措施之前，最起码你表现出愿意自己解决问题，这能证明你不是一个只会抱怨的人。你何不给他发一封邮件要求和他私下谈一谈呢?

　　M: Hmm, I’ve been a bit worried about his reaction. But anyway I'll send him an email to request a meeting, and I'll see what happens from there. Thanks for your advice.

　　男士：嗯，我一直担心他会是什么反应。无论如何，我会给他发邮件，然后看事态会如何发展。谢谢你的建议。

　　W: Good luck and let us know the outcome.

　　女士：祝你好运。有了结果之后请告知我们。
