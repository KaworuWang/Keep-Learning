M:Good morning.What can I do for you?

W:Good morning.Could I talk to Jeffery Harding, please?

M:Speaking.

W:Hello, Jeff.It's Helen.[8]I got your message on the answering machine.What's the problem?

M:Oh, Helen.Well, it's the Grimsby plant again, I'm afraid.[9]The robots on Line Three have gone wrong, and the line is at a standstill.

W:Can't you replace them with the stand-ins?

M:I'm afraid not.The stand-ins are already in use on Line Six.And the ones from Line Six are being serviced.

W:When did this happen, Jeff?

M:Well, they've been making a low continuous sound for a day or two, but they finally went dead at 2:30 this afternoon.

W:I see.What did you do? Have you tried the whole plant?

M:Not yet, Helen.[10]I thought I'd better get your OK first.

W:OK.Get on the phone to Tom, and try to get their stand-ins over tonight.We have to be back at full capacity tomorrow morning.Is it a major job to repair our robots?

M:About a week.That's what the maintenance engineer says.

W:Right.Well, if you can get the ones from a whole, please ask Tom to inform Sheffield that he may need their stand-ins in case of emergency during the next week.

M:OK.Thank you very much, Helen.

W:You're most welcome.

M:[11]Sorry to spoil your day-off.

W:It doesn't matter.
