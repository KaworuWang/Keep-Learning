W:This is Kerry Burke, from New York Daily News.[13]I'm speaking to Delroy Simmonds, an unemployed Brooklyn man who missed a job interview Tuesday for the best reasons.[12][14]He was saving the life of a 9-month-old boy who was blown into the path of an oncoming subway train by a high wind.

M:Everybody is making me out to be some sort of superhero.I'm just an ordinary person, and the father of two.Anybody in that situation would've done what I did.

W:You were going to an interview when the incident occurred, right?

M:Yes, I was on my way to apply for a maintenance position.I've been looking for a job for a year and more.I'm looking for something to support my family.

W:Tell us what happened at the station?

M:There was a strong wind.It had to be 30 to 40 miles an hour? There was a woman with 4 kids.One was in a pushchair.[14]The wind blew the baby onto the tracks.

W:[15]Witnesses said people were looking on in horror, as the child's mother identified by sources as Maria Zamara stood frozen in shock.In the distance, people could see the train rounding a bend headed into the station.I guess you were not aware of any of this, right?

M:No, I just jumped down and grabbed the baby.The train was coming around the corner as I lifted the baby from the tracks.I really wasn't thinking.

W:What an amazing story!Thank you very much.
