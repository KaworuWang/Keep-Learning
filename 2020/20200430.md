M: Err... Sandra, I've finished with Mr. Gartner now. Do you think you could pop through in bringing me up-to-date on their arrangements for the Italian trip?

W: Certainly, Mr. Wilkinson. I'll bring everything with me.

M: Right, take a seat. Now my first meeting is when?

W: Your first meeting is on Monday the 21st at 9a.m. with Dr. Gucci of Bancos en Piedra in Milan.

M: OK, so can I fly out early Monday morning?

W: Well, there is a flight to Lenarty Airport which leaves at six thirty London time and gets in at eight thirty Italian time.

M: Yeah, but that only leaves me thirty minutes to clear customs in getting to the city center and it means I have to check in by five thirty, which means leaving home at about four fifteen.

W: I'm afraid so.

M: Hmm... not so keen on that. What's the program for the rest of that day?

W: It's quite full, I'm afraid. At eleven, you're seeing Gianni Riva at Megastar and then you'll have a lunch engagement with Gavin from the Chamber of Commerce at one.

M: Where's that?

W: You're meeting him at his office and then he's taking you somewhere.

M: Good, that sounds fine. What about the afternoon?

W: Well, at three thirty, you're seeing our sales representative there and then you're free till evening.

M: I see. I seem to remember that I'm having a dinner with someone from Bergamo.

W: That's right. And Mr. Betty from SAP Industries at eight.
