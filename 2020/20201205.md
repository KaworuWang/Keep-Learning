W: Hi Leo, why do you say English would become the world language?
女：嗨，里奥，你为什么说英语会成为世界语言？
M: Well. For one thing, it's so commonly used. The only language that is used by more people is Chinese.
男：首先，英语的使用非常广泛。只有中文的使用人数比英语多。
W: Why is English spoken by so many people?
女：那为什么有这么多人说英语？
M: It's spoken in many countries of the world because of the British Empire. And now of course there is the influence of America as well.
男：因为大英帝国的扩张，世界上有很多国家都说英语。再加上现在还有美国的影响。
W: Many students find English a difficult language to learn.
女：很多学生发现，英语是一种很难学的语言。
M: Oh, all languages are difficult to learn. But English does have two great advantages.
男：哦，所有的语言都很难学。英语有两大优势。
W: What are they?
女：哪两种？
M: Well, first of all, it has a very international vocabulary. It has many German, Dutch, French, Spanish and Italian words in it. So speakers of those languages will find many familiar words in English. In fact, English has words for many other languages as well.
男：第一个是，英语的词汇非常国际化。英语词汇中包含许多德语、荷兰语、法语、西班牙语和意大利语词汇。以这些语言为母语的人会在英语中找到很多熟悉的词汇。实际上，英语还包括许多其他语言的词汇。
W: Why is that?
女：这是为什么呢？
M: Well, partly because English speakers have travelled a lot, they bring back words with them. So English really does have an international vocabulary.
男：部分原因是因为以英语为母语的人经常旅行，他们会带回来一些其他语言的词汇。所以英语的词汇非常国际化。
W: And what is the other advantage of English?
女：那英语的另一种优势呢？
M: It's that English grammar is really quite easy. For example, it doesn't have dozens of different endings for its nouns, adjectives and verbs, not like Latin, Russian and German for example.
男：那就是英语的语法非常简单。举例来说，英语的名词、形容词和动词没有数十种不同的结尾，与拉丁语、俄罗斯语、德语不同。
W: Why is that?
女：为什么？
M: Well, it's quite interesting actually. It's because of the French. When the French ruled England, French was the official language, and only the common people spoke English. They tried to make their language as simple as possible. So they made the grammar easier.
男：嗯，其实这很有意思。这是因为法国人。法国人统治英格兰时，法语是官方语言，只有普遍民众能说英语。他们试图让他们的语言尽量简单化。所以他们把语法制定得很简单。
