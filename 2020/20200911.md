Did you know that, besides larger places like France and Germany, Europe is home to several extremely tiny countries? One of these countries contains less than a square mile of land.Another is surrounded on all sides by Italy.Yet each is an independent land, with its own government, trade and customs.[22]One of the best known of these small countries is Monaco.It is situated on the Mediterranean Sea and surrounded by France on three sides.[23]Monaco became familiar to Americans when its ruler, Prince Rainier, married the American actress Grace Kelly.Rainier's family has ruled Monaco almost continuously since 1297.The land has been independent for over three hundred years.Andorra, with an area of some 200 square miles, is considerably larger than Monaco.This country is located in the Pyrenees Mountains, with France on one side and Spain on the other.Potatoes and tobacco are grown in Andorra's steep mountain valleys.[24]One of the products it exports is clothing.Andorra is also known for its excellent skiing locations.Within the Alps in Central Europe is Liechtenstein, a tiny country of about 30,000 people who speak mostly German.Liechtenstein uses the same money as its neighbor Switzerland, but it has been an independent country since the 1860s.Taxes are low, so many businesses have their headquarters here.The country makes and exports a lot of machinery.Other small independent states in Europe are San Marino and Luxembourg.Each of these has unique qualities as well.
