　My favorite TV show? “The Twilight Zone.” I especially like the episode called “The Printer’s Devil.” It’s about a newspaper editor who’s being driven out of business by a big newspaper syndicate – you know, a group of papers owned by the same people. He is about to commit suicide when he is interrupted by an old man who says his name is Smith. The editor is not only offered 5,000 dollars to pay off his newspaper’s debts, but this Smith character also offers his services for free. It turns out that the guy operates the printing machine with amazing speed, and soon he is turning out newspapers with shocking headlines. The small paper is successful again. The editor is amazed at how quickly Smith gets his stories – only minutes after they happen – but soon he is presented with a contract to sign. Mr. Smith, it seems, is really the devil! The editor is frightened by this news, but he is more frightened by the idea of losing his newspaper, so he agrees to sign. But soon Smith is reporting the news even before it happens – and it’s all terrible – one disaster after another. Anyway, there is a little more to tell, but I don’t want to ruin the story for you. I really like these old episodes of the Twilight Zone, because the stories are fascinating. They are not realistic. But then again, in a way they are, because they deal with human nature.
