The U.S.Postal Service announced today that[5]it is considering closing about 3,700 post offices over the next year because of falling revenues.

Facing an $8.3 billion budget deficit this year, closing post offices is one of several proposals the Postal Service has put forth recently to cut costs.Last week, for example,[6]Postmaster General Pat Donahoe announced plans to stop mail delivery on Saturdays, a move he says could save $3 billion annually.

“We are losing revenue as we speak,”Donahoe said.“We do not want taxpayers' money.We want to be self-sufficient.So like any other business you have to make choices.”

Dean Granholm, the vice president for delivery and post office operations, said the first wave of closings would begin this fall.[7]He estimated that about 3,000 postmasters, 500 station managers and between 500 and 1,000 postal clerks could lose their jobs.
