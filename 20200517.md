　　Conversation 1

　　W：Good evening, and welcome to this week’s Business World, the program for and about business people. Tonight, we have Mr. Steven Kayne, who has just taken over and established bicycle shop. Tell us, Mr. Kayne, what made you want to run your own store?

　　M: Well, I always loved racing bikes and fixing them. When I was working full-time as a salesman for a big company, I seldom had time to enjoy my hobby. I knew then that as soon as I had enough money to get my own business going, I’ll do it. I had my heart set on it and I didn’t let anything stand in my way. When I went down to the bank and got a business loan, I knew I’d love being my own boss. Now my time is my own. I open the store when I want and leave when I want。

　　W: You mean you don’t keep regular hours?

　　M: Well, the sign on my store says the hours are ten to six, but if business is slower than usual, I can just lock up and take off early。

　　W: Have you hired any employees to work with you yet?

　　M: Yeah, a couple of friends of mine who love biking as much as I do. They help me out a few days a week. It’s great because we play cards or just sit around and talk when there are no customers。

　　W: Thank you, Mr. Kayne. We wish you success in your new business。

　　Question 19-22 are based on the conversation you have just heard。

　　19.What is the woman doing?

　　20.What did Mr. Kayne do before he took over the bicycle shop?

　　21.Why did the man take over a bicycle shop?

　　Conversation 2

　　W: Well, the main activities in the region were historically steel and paper processing, I think。

　　M: Yes, but I’m not quite sure about the status of those industries now. Could you tell us something about that?

　　W: Yes, of course. In fact, they are less significant, but steel-related manufacturing still accounts for 44% of industrial activity. So it’s still very important. In fact, 80% of Spain’s machine tools are from the Basque Country. As for paper processing, there’s still a little. But it’s no longer what it once was in the region. So, is that clear?

　　M: Yes, thanks。

　　W: Now, to get back to what I was saying, there’s a lot of unemployment as well as geographical problems in the region。

　　M: Sorry, Victoria. What do you mean by geographical problems?

　　W: Well, what I mean is the area is very hilly, mountainous in parts. So there used to be transport problems, now though there are new train links and better roads, but it may be that some smaller towns inland remain not very well connected, is that OK? Does that make sense? When we talk about specific location suggestions for the factory, we’ll see this in more detail, so we’ll come back to this question, OK?

　　M: OK, right。

　　W: So I was about to say something about the work force in the region and the level of training and education. In general, it’s very good and improving。

　　Question 23-25 are based on the conversation you have just heard。

　　23. What does the woman say about the steel-related manufacturing in the region?

　　24. What problem hinders the region’s development?

　　25. What will the speakers discuss later?

　　Passage 1

　　I first met Joe Ganz when we were both nine years old, which is probably the only reason he’s one of my best friends. If I had first met Joe as a freshman in high school we wouldn’t even have had the chance to get to know each other. Joe is a day student, but I am a boarding student. We haven’t been in same classes, sports or extra-curricular activities. Nonetheless, I spend nearly every weekend at his house and we talk on the phone every night. This is not to say that we would not have been compatible if we had first met in our freshman year. Rather, we would not have been likely to spend enough time getting to know each other due to the lack of immediately visible mutual interests. In fact, to be honest, I struggle even now to think of things we have in common. But maybe that’s what makes us enjoy each other’s company so much. When I look at my friendship with Joe, I wonder how many people I’ve known whom I never disliked, but simply didn’t take the time to get to know. Thanks to Joe, I have realized how little basis there is for the social divisions that exist in every community. Since this realization, I have begun to make an even more determined effort to find friends in unexpected people and places。

　　Q:

　　26: Why does the speaker say Joe Ganz became one of his best friends?

　　27: Where does the speaker spend most of his weekends?

　　28: What has the speaker learned from his friendship with Joe?

　　Passage 2

　　It was a bad night for Lewis. His research in the neighboring town has taken longer than he expected. It was late and he was very tired when he drove home. He turned into his building’s parking lot, but all the spaces were full. He drove back out onto the street, looking for a parking space. The first block was full. The next block was almost empty. Lewis didn’t see a “no parking” sign, but he has expected that his parking were allowed there. Most the spaces would be filled. Then he saw a small parking lot with two free spaces. He was so glad to see them that he didn’t even think to read the sign by the entrance. He drove in, parked and hurried home to go to bed. The next morning he went back to the lot to get his car. It was gone. He ran home and telephoned the city police to say that his car had been stolen. It took the police only a minute to tell him what had happened: his car had been on a private lot. It had been taken away by the police. Lewis had to take a taxi to visit the city garage far from the city center. He had to pay a fee of 40 dollars to get his car back. In addition, he got a parking ticket, his first one ever in Greenville。

　　Q:

　　29: Where did Lewis intend to park his car when he came back from work one night?

　　30: What did Lewis think had happened to his car the next morning?

　　31: Where did Lewis finally get his car back?

　　Passage 3

　　Well, to pick up where we left off last time, I believe we agreed that creativity is a mysterious idea. It was those things we all recognize when we see it, but we don’t really understand what it is. We seem to feel that some people are naturally creative, but we don’t know how they got that way. Is creativity a natural gift like good looks, or is it something that can be acquired like knowledge? Perhaps if we analyze the creative process carefully, we might get some insight into what it is and how it might work in our lives. The creative process has always been accepted as the source of all important work in the arts, but we should not think the creativity plays a role only in the arts. Every major scientific discovery began with someone imagining the world to look differently from the way others saw it. And this is what creativity is all about -- imagining the world in a new way. And despite what you may believe about the limits of your own creative imaginations, we all have the potential to imagine the world in an absolutely new way. In fact, you are born with it. It is your birth right as a human being. And what’s more, you use it every day, almost every moment of your life. Your creative imagination is what you use to make sense of your experiences. It’s your creative mind that gets meaning from chaos of experiences and brings order to your world。

　　32. What did the speaker most probably discuss last time?

　　33. What is the widely accepted idea about the creative process?

　　34. What leads to major scientific discoveries according to the speaker?

　　35. What does the speaker imply about the creative process?

　　Students have been complaining more and more about stolen property. Radios, cell phones, bicycles, pocket calculators and books have all been reported stolen. Are there enough campus police to do the job? There are twenty officers in the campus security division. Their job is to handle crime, accidents, lost-and-found items and traffic problems on campus. More than half of their time is spent directing traffic and writing parking tickets.  Responding promptly to accidents and other emergencies is important, but it is their smallest job. Dealing with crime takes up the rest of their time. Very rarely do any violent crimes actually occur. In the last five years. There have been no murders, seven robberies and about 60 other violent attacks, most of these involving fights at parties. On the other hand, there have been hundreds of thefts and cases of deliberate damaging of public  property, which usually involves breaking windows or lights or writing on walls. The thefts are not the carefully planned burglaries that you see in movies. Things get stolen when it’s easy to steal them, because they are left lying around unwatched. Do we really need more police? Hiring more campus police will cost money, possibly making our tuition go up again. A better way to solve this problem might be for all of us to be more careful with our things。
