One notable animal dewelling is the water-protected lodge that beavers build.

The kangaroo rat feeds on dry thistle and cactus leaves, seeds, and small juicy tubers that grow below the surface.
It collects seeds in its cheek pouches and stores them in undergroud chambers.

Gophers and chipmunks also collect food in their cheek pouches and store it in underground pantries for future use.
