I have learned many languages, but I've not mastered them the way a professional interpreter or translator has. Still, they have open doors for me. They have allowed me the opportunity to seek jobs in international contexts and help me get those jobs. Like many people who have lived overseas for a while, I simply got crazy about it. I can't image living my professional or social life without international interactions. Since 1977, I have spent much more time abroad than in the United States. I like going to new places, eating new foods and experiencing new cultures. If you can speak the language, it's easier to get to know the country and its people. If I had the time and money, I would live for a year in as many countries as possible. Beyond my career, my facility with languages has given me a few rare opportunities. Once, just after I returned from my year in Vienna, I was asked to translate for a German judge at Olympic level horse event and learned a lot about the sport. In Japan, once when I was in the studio audience of a TV cooking show, I was asked to go up on the stage and taste the beef dish that was being prepared and tell what I thought. They asked "Was it as good as American beef?" It was very exciting for me to be on Japanese TV, speaking in Japanese about how delicious the beef was.
我学过很多种语言，不过我并不能像专业翻译那样掌握这些语言。不过，这些语言还是为我开启了大门。它们让我有机会在国际环境中找工作，并帮助我得到那些工作机会。和许多在海外生活过一段时间的人一样，我非常喜欢在海外生活。我无法想象在没有国际交往的情况下，度过我的职业生活和社会生活。从1977年开始，我在国外的时间比在美国的时间多得多。我喜欢去没去过的地方，品尝没吃过的食物，体验新的文化。如果你能说当地的语言，那了解那个国家和那里的人会更容易一些。如果我有时间有资金，我会尽量在更多的国家生活一年的时间。除了我的职业以外，我运用语言的熟练程度使我得到了一些难得的机会。有一次，我在维也纳生活一年之后刚刚回家，我就接到了为一名德国籍奥运会赛马比赛裁判当翻译的工作，我学到了很多有关这一比赛的知识。有一次在日本，我在一档美食节目做现场观众，录制中我被叫上台，品尝刚刚做好的牛肉餐，并说出我对这道菜的评价。他们问我：“这道菜和美国牛肉一样好吃吗？”能在日本电视节目中用日语描述这道牛肉餐有多好吃，我感到非常兴奋。
