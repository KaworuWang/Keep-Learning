A Fruitful Experiment in Land Conservation

In the fight to conserve tropical rainforests, here's a tool you don't often hear about: orange peels. Specifically, 12,000 tons of them, dumped on the land. "You don't usually associate waste disposal with biodiversity benefits, something that's good for the environment."

在热带雨林保卫战中，有一样不太常见的工具：橘子皮。具体来讲，是在热带雨林倾倒12000吨橘子皮。“人们通常不会觉得废物处理会有益于生物多样性，有益于环境。”

\Tim Treuer is an ecologist at Princeton University, and he’s talking about a unique conservation story. It started in the early 1990s, when an orange juice producer called Del Oro set up shop near the Guanacaste Conservation Area in Costa Rica, a region that contains several national parks and a wildlife refuge.

蒂姆·特罗伊尔是普林斯顿大学的一位生态学家，他为我们讲述了一个关于生态保护的特殊故事。这个故事始于上世纪90年代初，当时一个名叫德尔奥罗的橙汁生产商在哥斯达黎加的瓜纳卡斯特自然保护区附近开设了一家商店。瓜纳卡斯特自然保护区包括几个国家公园和一个野生动物保护区。

Del Oro needed somewhere to dump their orange peels, and the company also owned forested land abutting the parkland that it had no intention of cultivating. So a deal was struck: if Del Oro donated its forested land, it could dump orange peel waste on degraded pastureland within the conservation area.
