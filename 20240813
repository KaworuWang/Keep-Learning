the practice of genetic engineering

Almost every living cell hodls a vast storehous of inofrmation encoded in genes.
The artifical maipulation of one or more genes of mdify an organism is called genetic engineering.

Because this produces many copies of the recombinant DNA molecule, recombinant DNA technology is often called gene cloning.
In addition, When the bacteria's DNA initiates protein synthesis, the protein coded for by the inserted gene is produced.
