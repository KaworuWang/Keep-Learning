No one knows for sure just how old kites are. In fact, they have been in use for centuries. 25 centuries ago, kites were well known in China. These first kites were probably made of wood. They may even have been covered with silk, because silk was used a lot at that time.
没有人确切知道风筝有多少年历史。实际上，风筝的起源可追溯至几个世纪以前。2500年前，风筝开始在中国流行起来。最早的风筝可能是用木头制成的。当时的风筝甚至还会使用丝绸，因为当时丝绸使用广泛。
Early kites were built for certain uses. In ancient China, they were used to carry ropes cross rivers. Once across, the ropes were tied down and wooden bridges were hung from them. Legend tells of one general who flew musical kites over the enemies' camp. The enemy fled, believing the sounds to be the warning voices of angels. By the 15th century, many people flew kites in Europe. Marco Polo may have brought the kite back from his visit to China. The kite has been linked to great names and events. For instance, Benjamin Franklin used the kite to prove that lightning is electricity. He flew the kite in the storm. He did this in order to draw lightning from the clouds. He tied a metal key and a strip of silk to the kite line. The silk ribbon would stop the lightning from passing through his body. Benjamin's idea was first laughed at. But later on, it enlightened the invention of the lightning rod.
早期的风筝用于特定的用途。古代中国会在过河时用风筝牵引绳子。过河之后，把绳子系紧，挂在木桥上。传说古代有一名将军曾在风筝上放上乐器，然后放至敌军军营。敌人以为声音是天使的警告，便四散逃走。15世纪时欧洲有许多人开始放风筝。拒传风筝是马可·波罗从中国带至欧洲的。从古至今，风筝和许多大人物以及重大事件联系在一起。比如，本杰明·富兰克林曾用风筝证明闪电是电。他在暴雨中放风筝。他这么做是为了从云中引来闪电。他在风筝线上系上一把金属钥匙和一块丝绸。丝绸可以阻止闪电穿过他的身体。最初本杰明的想法遭到了嘲笑。但是之后，这个想法促成了避雷针的发明。
With such grand history, kite flying is sure to remain an entertaining and popular sport.
因为这些伟大的历史，放风筝肯定会保持其娱乐和受欢迎体育运动的地位。
