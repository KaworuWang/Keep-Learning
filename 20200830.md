[5]Three university students in Santiago, Chile, have developed a plant-powered device to charge their mobile phones.

[6]The three engineering students got the idea for the device while sitting in their school's courtyard.Their invention is a small biological circuit they call E-Kaia.It captures the energy which plants produce during photosynthesis, a process of converting sunlight into energy.

[7]A plant uses only a small part of the energy produced by that process.The rest goes into the soil.E-Kaia collects that energy.The device plugs into the ground and then into a mobile phone.

The E-Kaia solves two problems for the engineering students: they needed an idea for a class project; they also needed an outlet to plug in their phones.

[7]One of the student inventors, Camila Rupcich, says the device changes the energy released from the plant into low-level power to charge phones.

The E-Kaia is able to fully recharge a mobile phone in less than two hours.
