Every living thing is made up of tiny units called cells.
Each cell contains a set of instructions, known as its genetic code or genome, Which controls everything that happens in the organism.

In this example of genetic engineering, a gene for yellowness is transferred from a yellow pepper plant via a bacterium to a red tomato plant.
The process creates a new plant that will produce yellow tomatoes.

Once the new gene has been inserted, the host organism can be grown and tested.
Scientists check that the new gene has been incorporated into the organism's genome and that the new characteristic is present.
