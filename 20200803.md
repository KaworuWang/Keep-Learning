　　Almost all companies recognize the importance of

　　innovation today.

　　如今，几乎所有的公司都知道创新的重要性，

　　But not many are able to integrateinnovation into their business.

　　但是真正能够将创新融入到其业务当中的却不多。

　　A commentary in the Shanghai Daily points out that innovation doesn't mean piles of documents.

　　《上海日报》的一篇评论文章指出，发明并不简单的是一摞摞的文件。 It is something more practical.

　　而是实际的东西。

　　The article says many people tend to assume that

　　innovation just means creating something new,but actually it's more than that.

　　文章中说到，很多人认为发明就是创造出新的东西，但事实上不止如此。 It's an attitude of doing things.

　　它还代表了一种做事的方式。

　　A company should find ways to innovate not just in products but also in functions, business models and processes.

　　一个公司要寻求的不仅仅是产品创新，还应寻求运营、商业模式和流程方面的创新。

　　The article cites the global giant Procter & Gamble as an example, saying a real innovative company should develop an innovation culture and use it as a primary tool for success.

　　文章还引用了宝洁公司为例，称真正有创新精神的公司应该发展创新文化，并以其作为成功的主要工具。

　　Procter & Gamble has a "Corporate Innovation Fund" which offers big rewards for high-risk ideas that succeed.

　　宝洁公司有一个“企业创新基金”，该基金用于奖励获得成功的大胆创意。 It also has a special innovation facility for its employees. 该公司还有专门的员工创新基地。

　　Sometimes its employees are released from their daily jobs for weeks and spend their time interacting in the innovation facility instead.

　　有时候员工几个星期不去公司上班，而是在创新基地一起互动交流。

　　In conclusion, the article says innovative ideas alone do not ensure success.

　　归结起来，这篇文章表达的意思是创新的想法未必意味着成功。

　　It's pointless unless there is repeatable process in place to turn inspiration into financial performance.

　　如果不能将灵感通过某个过程转化为财务收益，所有的想法都是徒劳。 Questions 5 and 7 are based on the news report you have just heard.

　　Conversation One

　　M: So, Lyndsay, do you like to text message on your cell phone?

　　男士：林赛，你喜欢用手机发短信吗?

　　W: Yeah, I text message a lot.

　　女士：喜欢啊，我经常发。

　　M: I don't do it so much. I prefer to make a call if I'm in a hurry.

　　男士：我不是很喜欢。如果有急事我更喜欢打电话。

　　W: Yeah, I go both ways. Sometimes I don't really want to talk to the person. I just want to ask them one question, so it's much easier for me just to text message. If I call them, I'll have to have a long conversation.

　　女士：嗯，我两个都用。有时候我真的很不想和人说话。如果我只是想问一个问题，那发短信就简单多了。但是如果打电话，就得进行一次很长的对话。

　　M: Yeah, I can see what you mean. But I get off the phone pretty quickly when I call. I'm not a big talker.

　　男士：是的，我明白你的意思。但是我和别人打电话用的时间很短。我不是爱聊天的人。

　　W: Yeah, that's true. You don't talk a lot.

　　女士：你的确不太爱说话。

　　M: So are you fast at writing the messages with your thumb? 男士：那你发短信时打字快吗?

　　W: Well, when I first got a cell phone, I was so slow. I thought I would never text message. But then people kept text messaging me, so I felt obliged to learn how to text message. So now I'm pretty fast. What about you?

　　女士：啊，我刚用手机时，打字很慢。我想我永远都不会发短信。但是人们不断地给我发短信，弄得我不得不学。因此现在我打字很快了。你呢?

　　M: Actually I have the opposite problem. When I first got my cell phone, I thought it was so cool to text message all my friends who have one, and I was pretty fast with my thumb then. But it seems like now I don't use it so much, I've got slower actually.

　　男士：其实我刚好和你相反。我刚买手机的时候，给所有有手机的朋友都发短信，当时觉得那是一件很酷的事，所以那时候我的手很麻利。但是现在我不太发短信了，所以似乎也生疏了许多。

　　W: Yeah, I think text messaging actually sort of has to do with your age. For example, people in high school, they text

　　message a lot. But I ask my father if he text messages, and guess what he said?

　　女士：是的，我觉得是否喜欢发短信和年龄也有一定的关系。比如，高中生很爱发短信。但是我问我的父亲他是否发短信，你猜他怎么说? M: What?

　　男士：怎么说?

　　W: He said he never text messaged. He thinks it's very childish and unprofessional to text message.

　　女士：他说他从来没有发过。他说发短信很幼稚，而且很不专业。 M: Yeah, I can see what he means. It's considered pretty informal to text message someone.

　　男士：嗯，我能理解他。给别人发短信的确感觉很不正式。
