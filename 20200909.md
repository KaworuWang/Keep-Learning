There's one sound that gets a big reaction from kids on a hot day—the sound of an ice-cream truck.Maria McCartney has been in the mobile ice-cream business since 2005.[16]“When I was a little girl, I saw an ice-cream truck and knew I wanted to have one someday,”McCartney said.During the hot days of summer, Maria and her daughter drive an ice-cream truck through neighborhoods and parks in Billings.[17]It's not about making money for this former elementary school teacher.Rather, she wants to preserve the tradition of the neighborhood ice-cream truck.“Truly my favorite part is to see the kids jumping up and down, and they just get so excited.It's great to build a memory for them too.There are not a lot of these ice-cream trucks around anymore.The parents come out bare-foot and screaming, ready to buy ice-cream.They remember when they were kids they saw a truck,”She said.While the treats may be ice cold, Maria has a warm heart for little faces.[18]Her truck features a donation bucket for kids who don't have money for ice-cream.“When there are three kids and only two of them have money, I always make sure the third one gets something, because I can't drive away and have that third one not have something,”she said.
