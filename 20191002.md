Your Fat Needs Sleep Too

Sleep is good for you.
getting by on too little sleep increases the risk for heart disease stroke, high blood pressure,diabetes and other illnesses.
it also makes it harder to lose weight or stay slim because sleep deprivation makes you hungrier and less likely to be active during the day
now research shows that sleep also affects fat celss. 
our fat cells play an imprtant role in regulating energy use and storage, including insulin processing.
for the study , young healthy ,slim subjects spent four nights getting eight and a fhalf hours of sleep and four nights getting only four and a half hoursf  of sleep.
the difference in their fat cells was starting after sleep deprivating , cthe cells became 30 percent less receptive to insulin signals a difference that is as large as that between non diabletic and diabetic patients the fingdings are in annals of internal medicine 

looks like sleep is even more important than we thought for keeping our metabolisms running well. so consider this a wake up call
to get enought sleep
