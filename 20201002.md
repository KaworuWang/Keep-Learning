In college, time is scarce, and consequently, very precious.At the same time, expenses in college pile up surprisingly quickly.A part-time job is a good way to balance costs while ensuring there is enough time left over for both academic subjects and after-class activities.

If you are a college student looking for a part-time job, the best place to start your job search is right on campus.[16]There are tons of on-campus job opportunities, and as a student, you'll automatically be given hiring priority.Plus, on-campus jobs eliminate commuting time, and could be a great way to connect with academic and professional resources at your university.[17]Check with your school's careers service or employment office for help to find a campus job.Of course, there are opportunities for part-time work off campus, too.If you spend a little time digging for the right part-time jobs, you'll save yourself time when you find a job that leaves you with enough time to get your school work done, too.If you are a college student looking for work but worry you won't have enough time to devote to academic subjects, consider working as a study hall or a library monitor.[18]Responsibilities generally include supervising study spaces to ensure that a quiet atmosphere is maintained.It's a pretty easy job, but one with lots of downtime, which means you will have plenty of time to catch up on reading, do homework or study for an exam.
