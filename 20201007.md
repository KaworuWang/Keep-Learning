Today's consumers want beautiful handcrafted objects to wear and to have for their home environment.[22]They prefer something unique and they demand quality.Craftsmen today are meeting this demand.People and homes are showing great change as more and more unique handcrafted items become available.Handcrafts are big business.[23]No longer does a good craftsman have to work in a job he dislikes all day and then try to create at night.He has earned his professional status.He is now a respected member of society.Parts of the fun of being a craftsman is meeting other craftsmen.They love to share their ideas and materials and help others find markets for their work.[24]Craftsmen have helped educate consumers to make wise choices.They help them become aware of design and technique.They help them relate their choice to its intended use.They often involve consumers in trying the craft themselves.When a group of craftsmen expand to include more members, a small craft organization is formed.Such an organization does a lot in training workshops in special media, crafts marketing techniques, crafts fairs and sales, festivals, TV appearances and demonstrations.State art councils help sponsor local arts and crafts festivals which draw crowds of tourist consumers.[25]This boosts the local economy considerably because tourists not only buy crafts, but they also use the restaurants and hotels and other services of the area.
