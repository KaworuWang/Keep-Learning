Determining hwo animals evolved and how they should be classified are two important matters for biologists who study animal life.

Another fascinating area of inquiry is the amazingly varied behavior of animals.

All living animals are belived to have descended from common ancestors that were less specialized.
These relationships may be shown on a treelike diagram called a phylogenetic tree.
The word phylogenetic comes from two Greek words meaning "race history".

All animals have the ability to sense and respond to their surroundings.
The more highly developed animals have sense organs to perceive light, sound, touch, taste, and smell.
