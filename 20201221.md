Dr. Ben Carson grew up in a poor single-parent household in Detroit. His mother, who had only a third-grade education, worked two jobs cleaning bathrooms. To his classmates and even to his teachers, he was thought of as the dumbest kid in the class, according to his own not so fond memories. He had a terrible temper, and once threatened to kill another child. Dr. Carson was headed down a path of self-destruction until a critical moment in his youth. His mother convinced that he had to do something dramatic to prevent him from leading a life of failure, laid down some rules. He could not watch television except for two programs a week, could not play with his friends after school until he finished his homework, and had to read two books a week, and write book reports about them. His mother's strategy worked. "Of course, I didn't know she couldn't read. So there I was submitting these reports." he said. "She would put check marks on them like she had been reading them. As I began to read about scientists, economists and philosophers, I started imaging myself in their shoes." As he got into the habit of hard work, his grades began to soar. Ultimately he received a scholarship to attend Yale University, and later he was admitted to the University of Michigan Medical School. He is now a leading surgeon at Johns Hopkins Medical School and he is also the author of three books.
本·卡森医生在底特律一个贫穷的单亲家庭长大。他母亲只有小学三年级的文化水平，做两份清洁卫生间的工作。根据卡森医生不太美好的回忆，他的同学，甚至是老师都认为他是班里最笨的孩子。他脾气很差，曾经威胁说要杀了一名同学。如果不是抓住了年轻时的关键时刻，他很可能走上一条自我毁灭的道路。他的母亲认为他应该做一些重要的事情，来防止他过失败的人生，所以他母亲定下了一些规定。卡森医生每周只能看两个电视节目，放学以后完成作业才能和朋友们一起玩，每周要读两本书，而且要写读书报告。他母亲的方法很有效。他说，“当然我当时并不知道她不识字。所以我才会交那些读书报告。她会在读书报告上打分，装作她已经看过了。我在阅读有关科学家、经济学家和哲学家的书籍时，会把自己放在他们的角度去思考。”在他养成努力学习的习惯以后，他的成绩开始跃进。最后，他考进耶鲁大学并获得了耶鲁大学的奖学金，随后他被密歇根大学医学院录取。现在他是约翰·霍普金斯大学医学院的权威外科医生，而且已经出版了三本著作。
