A 16th century castle in Scotland is close to collapsing after lumps of soil were washed away by floods, threatening its foundations.

On Sunday, the castle's owner John Gordon, 76, was forced to move out of his property[1]after the River Dee swept away about 60 feet of land, leaving the castle dangerously close to the river, according to the Scottish Daily Record.

Abergeldie Castle, located in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, was built by Sir Alexander Gordon of Midmar, who later became the Earl of Huntly.

The castle, which is located on 11,700 acres, was leased to members of the royal family between 1848 and 1970, including King Edward VII and George V.

The Scottish Environment Protection Agency has issued more than 35 flood warnings covering several regions,[2]as Scotland continues to clean up after Storm Frank hit the country last Wednesday.

“This means that rivers will rise more slowly, but then stay high for much longer,”the environmental agency said.
